# Interprocedural-Constant-Propagation
This repository features an LLVM optimization pass for inter-procedural, context-insensitive, and flow-sensitive constant propagation that analyses and substitutes constant values across function boundaries. Key features include handling diverse data types and operations, and transforming variables and function arguments to constants.
